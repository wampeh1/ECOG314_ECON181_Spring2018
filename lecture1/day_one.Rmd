## Academic Integrity

Per the [Howard University Academic Code of Student Conduct](https://www.howard.edu/policy/academic/student-conduct.htm) we expect that you will:

* Work collaboratively on homework assignments but that each person will do their own write up of the solutions.

* Follow the guidelines for acceptable resources on the midterm exam.

* Cite all your sources on your project and that everything you write, even if it is just a summary of another paper, will be in your own words.

## How can you get help in this course?

We all know learning a new programming language is takes time. We want to be able to provide as much support as possible.

* Office hours at Howard 1-2 nights a week 6-8pm. We will post a tentative schedule and send email reminders.
* Piazza site allows you to ask questions and share code with everyone in the class and get answers quickly (average response time last semester was 1 hour)
* You will each be paired with an economist for your project who can help you work through the big picture issues you encounter (not for coding questions)
* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* Google (Part of this week's homework)

# Getting Started with R

## Why R?

* R is a statistical programming language with similarities to Stata, SASS, Python ...
* R is open source (FREE!)
* R makes it easier to make research reproducible: [Reinhart and Rogoff](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-reinhart-and-rogoff-controversy-a-summing-up)
* The R language is designed to make working with data convienient
* People who do new stuff do new stuff in R
* R is great for graphics
* There is a huge online support community 
* Lot's of jobs are looking for people who can use R effectivily

## The end result!

## R objectives for today

* Make a time series plot of US GDP
* Learn how to navigate the Rstudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* Understand the console and work space
* Run simple code at the command line
* Open and Save an R script

## Setting up your files for this class

Before we open up Rstudio and start coding we are going to walk through how you should organize your files for this class

* Make sure you are connected to the Board wifi
* Go to the website for this class
* Download all the files for lecture 1
* Create a folder in your documents called ECOG_314
* Make a subfolder for lecture 1

## Start/Open Rstudio

* Hopefully you have all already installed Rstudio
* If not please follow William's instructions to do so now
* If you have any difficulty let us know

# Work In RStudio

## How is Rstudio organized?

* Work space
* Console
* Environment / History
* File / Plot/ Packages/ Help
* Open a new R script (File -> New File -> R Script)
* Let's make a comment
* Save the R script in ECOG314 -> Lecture 1 as lecture_1.R
* Close Rstudio and open the file lecture_1.R

## Using R as a calculator

R has all of our familiar mathematical operations:

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Exponentiation (^)

Try doing the following calculations 

* 3 plus 4
* 10043 plus 123548
* 3 times 5
* (6 plus 5 times 4) divided by 2
* 2 to the 5th power

## Coding at the command line

* At the command line type `1+1`
* Now try `x <- 1 + 1`
* What about `y <- x + 1`
* Click on the Environment tab. What does this window show you?
* Click on the History tab. What does this window show you?
* What is `x`? what is `y`?

## Variables in R

* What is a variable?
* We can assign variables using the `<-` operator. 
* Let's assign the value 41 to `x` and print the result
* How can we get information on a function (like print) in Rstudio? Using the ?function

## Variables in R continued

* Create a variable called **my_amazing_number** with a value of 1. Print out the value of my_amazing_number.
* Now add **x** to **my_amazing_number** and assign the result to a new variable called **the_best_number**. Print out **the_best_number**

## Variable Classes in R

* The class of a variable tells you what kind of values you can expect.
* The most basic classes or types of variables in R are:
  + Numeric – decimals like 1.1,3.1415926, 1000024.5
  + Integer – natural numbers like 1,2,3,4
  + Logical – Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)
  + Character – text (often called strings) like “This is soooo cool!”, “I love R”
  + Factors - A way that R stores strings as numbers to speed up calculations
  + Dates - Don't worry to much about these yet
  + NA

## Variable Classes in R continued

* Create a variable called my_numeric that has the value 1.1
* Create a variable called my_integer that is 1
* Create a variable called my_logical that is TRUE
* Create a variable called my_character that is “one”
* Print out the value of each variable
* Check the class of each variable using the str() function
* What happens if you type as.character(my_numeric)?

## Boolean Values

* What happens if you type x == y into R?
* Test out some of these other logical operators:
    + ==
    + >, >=
    + <, <=
    + !=
* How can we combine logical conditions?
    + using or (|)
    + using and (&)


## Vectors in R

* We can create vectors in R using the c() function.
* The c() function combines values into a vector
* Try it out!
  + c(1,2,3)
  + x <- c(1,2,3)
  + c(x,x)
* Create a vector called numeric_vector with the values 1.1 , 2.2, 3.3
* Create a vector called character_vector with the values “a”,”b”,”c”
* Create a vector called boolean_vector with the values TRUE,FALSE,TRUE
* Print out each vector and get it's class
* What about the vector combined_vector <- c(1.1, "a", TRUE)?
* How could we test if 3 is in the vector x? (%in%)


## Keyboard shortcuts

* Ctrl + s: SAVE!
* Ctrl + Enter: Run current line/selection
* Ctrl + Shift + S: Source the current file
* Esc: Interrupt current command 
* Ctrl + L: Clear console
* Ctrl + Shift + F10: Restart R Session


## Let's take a step back

![Hadley Wickham - R For Data Science (2016)](hadley_cycle.pdf)

## Back to economics

* Why do we as aspiring economists and as world citizens care about the gross domestic product of a country?

* Why does the Federal Reserve care about this measure of economic activity?

* How might the Federal Reserve respond to changes in GDP?

## Looking at the data

* Read in GDP data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) using read.csv()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
read.csv("GDP.csv")
```

```{r}
gdp <- read.csv("GDP.csv")
```

* Look at the structure using str()

```{r, comment = NA}
str(gdp)
```

* What structure does R store this data as?

## Looking at the data continued 

* Let's get a quick look at the data using the head() function

```{r}
head(gdp)
```
* What does the head function do? How could you find the answer? What does the tail function do?

* Use the head function to look at the first 10 rows of data.

* Use the tail function to look at the last 8 years of data.

## GDP - Data Structure

* Let's take a closer look at the date column using the "$" operator

```{r}
str(gdp$DATE)

head(gdp$DATE)
```

* What does R tell us about the structure of this column?
* What about the other columns
* What is the frequency of these data?

## GDP - Data Structure

* Factors can be useful but are generally unpleasent to work with
* Let's go back and fix how we read in the data file

```{r}
gdp <- read.csv("GDP.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

* What's the structure of gdp now?

## GDP - plotting

* One of the best ways to understand data is to create a visualization.

* What would be a simple way of visualizing this time series?


## GDP - plotting data prep

* Before we can plot the data we need to convert the DATE column to be a Date type instead of a factor.
* How do we "access" the date column in the gdp data.frame?
* How do we assign variables?
* What does the as.Date() function do?

```{r}
gdp$DATE <- as.Date(gdp$DATE)
```

## GDP - plotting for real

* How many recessions can you see?

```{r, fig.height= 4}
ggplot(gdp) +
geom_line(aes(x = DATE, y = GDPC1))
```

## Wrapping up

* Please save all your code from class today! It will be very helpful going forward.
* There is a homework for this coming. Before you leave make sure you can open it!
