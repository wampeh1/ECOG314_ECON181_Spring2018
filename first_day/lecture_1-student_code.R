######## Exercise 1 ######## 

#Try doing the following calculations 

# 3 plus 4

# 10043 plus 123548

# 3 times 5

# (6 plus 5 times 4) divided by 2

# 2 to the 5th power

############################ 


######## Exercise 2 ######## 

# Create a variable called my_numeric that has the value 1.1

# Create a variable called my_integer that is 1

# Create a variable called my_logical that is TRUE

# Create a variable called my_character that is “one”

# Print out the value of each variable

# Check the class of each variable using the str() function

# What happens if you type as.character(my_numeric)?

############################ 


######## Exercise 3 ######## 

#Assign `x <- 24`

# Test if x is equal to 25

# Test if x is greater than 5

# Write a condition that will return `FALSE`

# Test if x is greater than 5 and less than 25

# Write a condition using or that will return `TRUE`

############################ 


######## Exercise 4 ######## 

# Create a vector called numeric_vector with the values 1.1 , 2.2, 3.3

# Create a vector called character_vector with the values “a”,”b”,”c”

# Create a vector called boolean_vector with the values TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

# Print out each vector and get it's class

# What about the vector combined_vector <- c(1.1, "a", TRUE)?

# How could we test if 3 is in the vector x? (%in%)

######## Exercise 5 ######## 

#Install and load the package tidyverse

######## Exercise 6 ######## 

# Read in GDP data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) using read_csv()

gdp <- read_csv("")

# Let's get a quick look at the data using the head() function

# What does the head function do? How could you find the answer? What does the tail function do?

# Use the head function to look at the first 10 rows of data.

# Use the tail function to look at the last 8 years of data

############################ 



######## Exercise 7 ######## 

# We can also access a entry in a data frame using [row(s), column(s)]

# What is in the first row second column of gdp?

# What is in the third row of gdp?

# What about the first column of gdp?

# What about the third and fourth row from the first column of gdp?
